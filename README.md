30 Days of Terraform Challenge

Welcome to the 30 Days of Terraform Challenge repository! I’ll be learning and applying Terraform to build, manage, and document cloud infrastructure as code (IaC).

🚀 Project Overview

This challenge is designed to:

Deepen my understanding of Terraform, AWS, and general DevOps practices.

Provide a structured, daily log of reading, hands‑on labs, and blog writing.

Share insights, code snippets, and best practices with the community.
