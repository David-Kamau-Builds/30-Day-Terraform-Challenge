# 30 Days of Terraform Challenge

Welcome to the **30 Days of Terraform Challenge** repository! This is my personal learning journey where I’ll be diving deep into **Terraform** to build, manage, and document cloud infrastructure as code (IaC).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This challenge is designed to:

* Deepen my understanding of **Terraform**, **AWS**, and broader **DevOps** practices.
* Provide a structured, daily log of reading, hands‑on labs, and reflections.
* Share insights, code snippets, and best practices with the community.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
./
├── Day-1/                     # Subfolder for Day 1 of the challenge
│   ├── day1-DavidKibe.md      # Summary of Day 1 activities
│   ├── images/                # Screenshots and diagrams for Day 1

└── README.md                  # This file: project overview and repo layout
```

Each `Day-X/` folder contains:

* A daily log markdown file (`dayX-DavidKibe.md`) with progress, code snippets, and reflections.
* An `images/` subfolder for any supporting screenshots or diagrams.

## 📖 Daily Workflow

1. **Read & Review**: Study a chapter, article, or official documentation.
2. **Hands-On Labs**: Implement Terraform configurations in a real or simulated environment.
3. **Document**: Summarize key learnings and challenges in the daily markdown file.
4. **Share**: Publish a blog post (Medium) and post an update on LinkedIn.
5. **Commit & Push**: Add, commit, and push updates to the corresponding day folder.
