# 30 Days of Terraform Challenge

Welcome to my 30 Days of Terraform Challenge! This repository documents my daily progress as I learn and apply Terraform to build infrastructure as code (IaC).

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal is to deepen my understanding of Terraform, cloud infrastructure (primarily AWS), and DevOps best practices by completing hands-on tasks over 30 days.

## 📅 Day 1 Progress

I :

* Read a couple of pages from Chapter 1
* Completed hands-on labs to build Cloud Services
* Document my progress in a Markdown file ( `day1-DavidKibe.md`)
* Shared my learnings through blog posts and social media
